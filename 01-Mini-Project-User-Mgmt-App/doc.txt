>9 sept > controller and ui of 1st project
> 12 sept >>>>>>>>18 min is important concept
> 13 sept >>>>>>>>>imp issues. of first project
		1>issue > empty field is also submitting > so added required field in client side
		2>issue > after editing the record > dob is not pre-populating.
		3>issue > for every request , a seperate model object is created.
		so after adding msg is model object , that msg is not showing in ui
		coz ,we are redirecting our request .
		that's why we should use "forward " instead of "redirect".
		>when request is redirecting from one method to another method , 
		the @ModelAttribute concept will not work.

> so now when we delete a record , then >table updating > means "forward is workin
and "User Record Deleted" msg is showing means > Model object is also working.

>issue > double posting problem > after form is submitted > user record is still 
there in UI page , >so there may occur a double posting problem.
that's why > after saving the user data > forward the page to an empty page.

"forward" will also not work coz , post and get request pbm.
and if we use "redirect" > then success msg will not come. 


complex issue : 1 h:1 min.>17 aug. >first analysis is wrong,
user.setActiveSw("Y"); in /save-user class

>issue> saving and then edit modify to "activate" and again save then
		automatically status is changing to "De-Activate" status .
that's coz in "Entity" class we are giving the default status switch as "Y" .
>so to fix this > we remove the default value from Entity class and
					At first time saving , we are saving the value as "Y".
					when we are updating the record ,we are not setting anything.

>so set the user record as "Y" when we are inserting the user record.
so conditionally we need to set whether our record is active or inactive.
so first time set it as "Y" second time as hidden variable.
